Data Mining Final Project
Used twitter scraper to generate location and time specific data sets regarding electricity prices to test hypothesis that sentiment of tweets can be used to predict electric cost's.
* Built twitter scraper
* Preprocessed data for sentiment analysis
* Implemented machine learning algorithm Naive Bayes Classifier
* Applied Classifier to prebuilt sentiment data set and achieved 99.96% accuracy on 2000 tweets
* Applied the trained model to generated state data sets and used the outcome to predict electric costs as either rising or falling in that state
* Correctly Predicted 7/10 States
* Created GUI to display results
