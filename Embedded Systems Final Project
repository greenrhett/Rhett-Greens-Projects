Embedded System Final Project
For my final project I built an attack on my own computer a 2017 MacBook Pro that would grant me remote access. Initially I attempted to gain access through open 
ports via IP address retrieval and port scanning but the nature of MacOS operating system made this unlikely had it been a Windows based operating system this 
approach could have been viable. I therefore had to create a RAT and installed it on my system by disguising it as a basic file that when clicked creates a 
backdoor which opens a meterpreter session between the victims system and my host system from which I can access there files and even plant new ones for further 
attacks.
