To create my first person shooter game I used the Unreal Engine 4 the same platform the popular game Fortnite runs on. Unreal engine is C++ based development but they offer a helpful GUI that allows you to build the game through blueprinting. Blueprinting is a complete gameplay scripting system based on the concept of using a node-based interface to create gameplay elements to define object-oriented classes or objects in the engine. At first it was a bit overwhelming but it's structure was very similar to the object oriented programming I've done in the past.
* Used whiteboxing and texturing to create interactive map
* Handled physics of players, projectiles, map, and their interactions together
* Created interactable characters with health and death scenes
* Created UI for players to interact with and to be prompted upon actions
* Created a host server and client servers that can interact with each other for multiplayer play

Download File "Game" to play:
* For multiplayer use have one player click "Host" button
* Other player types in hosts local IP address and clicks Connect
* Game ends after one player depletes other players health with projectiles and "You Died" UI is prompted
